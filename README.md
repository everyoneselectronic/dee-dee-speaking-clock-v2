# Limmy's Dee Dee Speaking Clock!

I recreated [Limmy's](https://twitter.com/DaftLimmy) speaking clock [webpage](http://www.limmy.com/deedeespeakingclock/) to work as a real speaking clock that you can ring.

Ring the following number to hear the time

+44 20 3808 7032
(The time is set to only work for UK time)

# About
The speaking clock uses [Sinch](https://www.sinch.com), [Node](https://nodejs.org) and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
